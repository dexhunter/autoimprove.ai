            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are a passionate team of researchers and engineers focused on the core challenge of enabling AI systems to continuously enhance their capabilities without human intervention. Our work explores novel algorithms, architectures, and theoretical foundations for self-improving artificial intelligence.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="research">
            <h2>Our Research Focus</h2>
            <p>Our primary research areas include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reinforcement Learning with Self-Modification</li>
                <li>Meta-Learning and AutoML</li>
                <li>Lifelong Learning Systems</li>
                <li>AI Safety and Alignment in Self-Improving Systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe that true artificial general intelligence will emerge from systems that can understand their own limitations and actively seek to overcome them.</p>
